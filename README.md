# Utility functions for Bash

The idea behind this repository is to create consistency in the Bash scripts
I write by providing a number of functions that can be sourced individually and
(hopefully) will be able to centralize some of the common scaffolding
that is repeated in a lot of my scripts.

The focus of this repository is not performance but my own convenience -
not that performance isn't important - but I am simply not experienced enough
to consider performance.
